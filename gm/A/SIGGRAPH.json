  "remarks": "From 2022 onwards, SIGGRAPH adopts a two-track model: papers submitted to the journal-only track will only be considered for publication in the journal, while those submitted to the dual-track will also be considered for publication in the conference proceedings. On this page, '# submitted' in the [Main Research Track] represents # of papers submitted to the dual-track. '# submitted' in the [Journal Track] represents two-track total submissions.",
