## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
Last update: Oct 23rd, 2025

### Preamble

Open Accept (OAc) is a community‑driven open‑source project for collecting and sharing metadata on paper acceptance rates at global computer science conferences. We value the contributions of all participants and strive to create a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment. This Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines the standards of behavior we expect from anyone who interacts with the project—whether as a contributor, maintainer, reviewer, or user.

By participating in Open Accept, you agree to abide by this CoC. We are committed to fostering a safe space where everyone can collaborate without fear of harassment or discrimination.


### Our Standards

We expect participants to:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Be respectful** | Treat everyone with courtesy and consideration, even when you disagree. |
| **Be inclusive** | Welcome people of all backgrounds, identities, and experience levels. |
| **Be considerate** | Use welcoming language, be mindful of tone, and avoid sarcasm or jokes that could be misinterpreted. |
| **Be collaborative** | Share knowledge, give constructive feedback, and help others grow. |
| **Be mindful of privacy** | Do not share personal or sensitive information without explicit permission. |
| **Be open‑minded** | Accept that there are many perspectives and approaches; be willing to learn. |

**Unacceptable behavior** includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination (based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, age, nationality, or any other protected characteristic).
- Threats of violence or personal attacks.
- Unwelcome sexual advances, lewd or pornographic comments, or any form of sexual harassment.
- Disparaging remarks about a person’s or group’s identity, appearance, or background.
- Persistent, unwanted, or unsolicited contact (e.g., spamming, “dogpiling”).
- Use of profanity or slurs that are harassing, hateful, or demeaning.
- Any other conduct that creates a hostile or uncomfortable environment.


### Our Responsibilities

**Project maintainers** and **community leaders** are responsible for:

- **Enforcing** this CoC fairly and consistently.
- **Modeling** the behavior we expect from everyone.
- **Providing** a safe, private channel for reporting incidents.
- **Taking** appropriate corrective action (e.g., warning, temporary ban, permanent ban) based on the severity and context of the violation.
- **Documenting** outcomes in a way that respects privacy and confidentiality.


### Scope

This CoC applies to all spaces related to Open Accept, including but not limited to:

- Public and private repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
- Issue trackers, pull‑request reviews, and project boards.
- Discussion forums, mailing lists, chat rooms (e.g., Discord, Slack, IRC, Matrix).
- Social media accounts, blogs, conferences, meet‑ups, and any other venues where the project’s community interacts.


### Enforcement

**Reporting**

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this CoC, please report it promptly. Reports can be made via Email: `openaccept[AT]proton[DOT]me`. 

**What happens after a report?**

1. **Acknowledgment** – You will receive a confirmation that the report was received (usually within 24 hours).
2. **Investigation** – The maintainers will review the evidence, talk to involved parties (confidentially), and assess the situation.
3. **Response** – A decision will be communicated to the reporter and, when appropriate, to the accused party.
4. **Action** – Depending on the findings, actions may include: a private warning, a temporary suspension, a permanent ban, or mediation.
5. **Appeal** – If you feel the decision was unfair, you may request a review by contacting `openaccept[AT]proton[DOT]me`.

**Confidentiality** – All reports are handled with discretion. Personal information will not be disclosed without consent, unless required by law.
